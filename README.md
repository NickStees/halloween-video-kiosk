# halloween-video-kiosk

This webpage was created to run on a rasberryPi as a full screen web kiosk to play AtmosFX videos in a full screen environment. The rasberryPi on boot launches Google Chromes kiosk mode.

### Features
- Videos automatically start playing
- Videos are randomized at the start to give a variety in performances
- Select videos can be triggered by keyboard keys (used for jump scares)
- Videos will fill to viewport container and work with any resolution.

## Getting started
Mainly you just have to clone this project, add videos to the /video folder, and change the javascripts videoSources array to match your video files. If you bring up the browsers F12 you can watch the console and find they keyboard commands to select videos by modifying the script.

#### Happy Halloween and Enjoy!
